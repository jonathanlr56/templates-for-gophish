Phishing Templates

In this repo are two folders. One has a bunch of phishing email templates to be used with GoPhish This would be the email folder. Emails can be modified to include custom company information or sent as is.

The other folder holds an informational landing page for those who click emails. It notifies them they were phished and gives them tips to avoid it in the future. The html will need a company logo and a static image for the second tip.
